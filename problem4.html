        <p>Friction is the force that opposes the motion of objects sliding or moving past each other. It occurs when two
        surfaces come into contact, and the microscopic bumps and irregularities on each surface catch and resist
        movement. Friction is essential in everyday life because it allows us to walk without slipping and cars to grip
        the road. However, it can also cause wear and tear on mechanical parts and reduce efficiency by turning some
        energy into heat. Understanding friction helps engineers design better machines and materials that either reduce
        or increase this force, depending on the need</p>
